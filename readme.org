* Models of Interaction

Models of Interaction is a catalogue of the different ways of interacting with computers and their underlying models. This is one segment of a trilogy. The other parts are called *Models of Computer* and *Models of Computation*. This is an attempt at trying to understand the prime factors which are involved into understanding the process of performing computation from end to end.

Hope you enjoy this curation!

** Design ∩ Code

[[./img/design-code-cover.png]]

This is a curation of tools that blur the line between design and engineering. Check out the tweet thread here for a more fuller curation while I integrate them here: https://twitter.com/prathyvsh/status/1326687222507077637

**** Baku Hashimoto

[[./img/glisp.png]]

A Lisp-based design tool that bridges graphic design and computational arts. It is a polished product that shows the power of having linguistic abstractions juxtaposed with an interactive design space.

What is double awesome is Baku is using this to run [[https://twitter.com/_baku89/status/1322901592685699075][his own design experiments]], much like Karsten Schmidt does with his Umbrella.

Each tool built by [[https://100r.co/][hundredrabbits]] is worth checking out. They have this aesthetic that transports you to a parallel world that coexist with ours. They are pushing the boundaries of art and trailblazing a way of living.

**** Matthew Keeter

[[./img/libfive.mp4]]

It is a solid modelling tool with a Guile Scheme based code editor that is suited for parametrized / procedural designs.

**** Jon Gold

[[./img/rene.png]]

René by Jon Gold is a design tool with which one can declaratively describe styles and explore their space of permutations: http://rene.jon.gold

The rationale for its design can be read in this post by Jon: https://jon.gold/2016/06/declarative-design-tools/

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer][Quartz Composer]]
**** Pietter-Oliver Latour

[[./img/quartz-composer.png]]

Quartz Composer was such a fun nodes and wires environment to do design + coding work in. Pierre–Oliver Latour made this tool inspired from Miller Puckette’s music synthesis environment [[https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/miller-puckette-the-man-behind-the-max-and-pd-languages-and-a-lot-of-crazy-music][Max]] and Apple acquired it.

One slick environment in this category is Protoboard by Szymon Kaliski: https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/protoboard/

Szymon makes a lot of other cool experiments and if you are interested in this space, you should definitely checkout his other stuff: https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/

*** [[https://cables.gl][Cables]]
**** Undev Studio

Cables is a tool for creating high end real time interactive graphics in a node-based editing environment: https://cables.gl

*** [[https://paperjs.org][PaperJS]]
**** Jürg Lehni, Jonathan Puckey

[[./img/paperjs.png]]

Paper.js (used to be known as Scriptographer) is an amazing Javascript library for creating canvas graphics. It has a sketch environment to debug drawings. It unlocked a special wave of creative stuff during 2010s.

Shade is an amazing shader editor tool designed by Two Lives Left. It has some pretty sweet interaction design.

*** [[https://origami.design][Origami]]

[[./img/origami.png]]

One of the cool spin offs of Quartz Composer is Origami. Brandon Walkin and team took Quartz Composer from where Apple left it to a refined product that allows for prototyping interactions for mobiles and desktops.

[[./img/framer.png]]

An environment that started out as a Javascript animation library but transformed into a full blown prototyping environment is Framer built by the old Made By Sofa team.

*** [[http://macaw.co/][Macaw (Acquired by InVision)]]

[[./img/macaw.jpg]]

Macaw was a design tool built circa 2014 that enabled visually coding websites. The app was discontinued once the team joined Invision but it was a product with an interesting design direction.

*** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy5m091fOTU][DeepUI (Prototype)]]

What if you could describe your software without using text but gestures that describe the behaviours? DeepUI took a bold move in this direction. The environment hasn’t shipped yet but it was a daring take on what it means to develop software.
