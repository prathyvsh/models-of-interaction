* Models of Interaction

Models of Interaction is a catalogue of the different ways of interacting with computers and their underlying models. This is one segment of a trilogy. The other parts are called *Models of Computer* and *Models of Computation*. This is an attempt at trying to understand the prime factors which are involved into understanding the process of performing computation from end to end.

Hope you enjoy this curation!

A Lisp-based design tool that bridges graphic design and computational arts. It is a polished product that shows the power of having linguistic abstractions juxtaposed with an interactive design space.

What is double awesome is Baku is using this to run [[https://twitter.com/_baku89/status/1322901592685699075][his own design experiments]], much like Karsten Schmidt does with his Umbrella.

Each tool built by [[https://100r.co/][hundredrabbits]] is worth checking out. They have this aesthetic that transports you to a parallel world that coexist with ours. They are pushing the boundaries of art and trailblazing a way of living.
