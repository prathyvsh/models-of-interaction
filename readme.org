* Models of Interaction

Models of Interaction is a catalogue of the different ways of interacting with computers and their underlying models. This is one segment of a trilogy. The other parts are called *Models of Computer* and *Models of Computation*. This is an attempt at trying to understand the prime factors which are involved into understanding the process of performing computation from end to end.

Hope you enjoy this curation!
